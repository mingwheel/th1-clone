# [Website Theme Clone](https://mingwheel.github.io/th1-clone)

This is a beginner project for me to practice my **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** skills after 1 month+ of learning.

Here is the [**original website**](https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-agency/) that I referenced.

## Learning Points & Notes

#### HTML
+ Learned to create a markup layout from scratch!
+ Learned to use `div.container` as a layout element that aligns everything on the page with same margins/paddings.
+ Learned to use semantic elements like `nav`, `header`, `section`, `footer` for layout.
  
#### CSS
+ Learned to name CSS classes properly for modularity.
+ Learned to use **flexbox** to `align-items` and `justify-content`, with `flex-basis` to 'grid' items.
+ Learned to use css variables for more semantic and reusable theme styles. 
  
#### Javascript
+ Learned how to implement smooth scrolling with help from external script.


#### Notes
+ Though this is just a small simple practice, I identified a lot of repeated code (e.g. `page-sections`, `portfolio-item`...). A library like **React** could help me understand how to better build modular components? Or a static site generator like **Jekyll** or **Gatsby JS**?

+ SS classes naming could still improve certainly. Maybe for a small 'project' like this it is quite hard to grasp its full potential.
